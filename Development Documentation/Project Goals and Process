3D_PRINTmetheus
A custom 3D printer controller system

Goals: (no order)
	-Remotely level the bed
	-Remotely upload file to 3D printer and start print
	-Notify phone of issue and stop (UPS to check power failure)
	-Weigh the spools and preemptively warn you
	-Camera viewer with lighting control
	-AI failure detection
	-Maintenance reminder
	-Status screen (16x2 LCD or something similar)
	-Arduino Integration (If using laptop)
  	-Check kWh used and calculate cost of printing

Electrical Goals:
  	-Fewest wire strands possible (use USBs or other integrated cables)
  	-No custom interaction with AC power (find a premade outlet relay)
  	-Based off of 24V
  	-All components not location dependent (computer, power, display, etc) fit within Ender3 footprint, and can be placed directly underneath and Ender3
  	-All orderable off Amazon, Adafruit

Plan
  	Sections in Order:
    	-Main system development
			-Uses Linux
			-Needs to support multiple printers and related components
			-Easy configuration at any time
				-Everything is toggleable
			-Needs to be distributable (easy to download/install, good README on github, not hard coded IP addresses or anything)
			-Custom OS for Pi?

    	-3D printer control over USB (using G-code commands via Marlin Firmware)
			-Custom firmware using the official Marlin 2.0 and presets
			-Need a USB cable per printer
			-Send G-code commands over the USB as a virtual serial port
			-DO NOT actively send g-code to printers, download file to SD card and start it

    	-Camera integration
			-Probably using something like mjpeg-viewer

		-Remote control
			Remote Interface Options:
				Port Forwarding Website
					Cyber security issue
				Free Website Hoster
					Can it be done via code? Want to be able to distribute it without a fuss
				Phone app
					Will probably still need a website
					Probably an end goal
				Discord
					People already use it
					Bad for video and commands
			Capabilities Needed:
				-Turn off printer (at least stop)
				-View camera
				-Upload files
				-Other things later
		-Lighting control
			-RGB and regular LED capabilities
			-Need to be able to specify which one
			-Attached to a specific printer or for all?
			-Add Pi outputs or Arduino, so old laptops can be used

    	-AI detection of spaghetti, clog, first layers issues (in that order)
			-Needs to be lightweight (YOLO model?)
				-Should be every 1-30 seconds
			-Should be able to toggle which ones matter
			-Priorities in order:
				Spaghetti detection
				Clog detection
				First layer/warping issues
				Maybe stringiness?
				Other small model defects for ultra nice looking prints?

		-External component control
			-Use the unofficial KASA api to wirelessly control outlets for 3D printers (maybe read kWh)
			-Something that cleans build plate?
			-Add Pi outputs or Arduino, so old laptops can be used
			-Filament dryer box control

		-External Inputs
			-Add Pi inputs or Arduino serial, so old laptops can be used
			-Replacement spool holder that weighs the spool and filament (can select which company spool is from so it automatically subtracts that weight, tell if new spool and it'll calibrate)
			-Filament humidity

		-”Plugin” capabilities
			-IDK seems professional
